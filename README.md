# JavaScript NaN behavior with null and undefined in addition

This code demonstrates unexpected behavior when adding `null` and `undefined` values in JavaScript.  Specifically, it highlights how `null` and `undefined` behave differently in arithmetic operations, often leading to `NaN` (Not a Number) results.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to mitigate the issue using explicit type checking and default values.

## Bug

The primary issue is the inconsistent handling of `null` and `undefined` during addition.  `undefined` consistently leads to `NaN` while `null` is treated as `0` in some contexts and `NaN` in others, depending on the surrounding values and operation.

## Solution

The solution involves adding checks for `null` and `undefined`, providing default values to avoid these inconsistencies.  Explicit type checking ensures consistent, predictable results.

This example is important for understanding how JavaScript handles type coercion and why careful attention to null and undefined values is necessary to avoid unexpected behavior and errors in applications.
